# Value Assessment Criteria for MCP Service

## Purpose
This document outlines the criteria used to assess the value of recorded problems within the MCP service. The goal is to ensure that only high-value issues are documented and addressed, enhancing the overall efficiency of the development process.

## Value Criteria

1. **Complexity of Solution**
   - Problems that require non-intuitive solutions or involve complex reasoning should be recorded. This includes issues where the solution is not readily apparent or requires deep understanding of the underlying technology.

2. **Frequency of Occurrence**
   - Issues that are encountered frequently across different projects or components should be documented. This helps in identifying patterns and common pitfalls that can be addressed proactively.

3. **Impact on Development**
   - Problems that significantly hinder development progress or cause delays should be prioritized. If an issue takes considerable time to resolve (e.g., more than 15 minutes), it should be recorded for future reference.

4. **Learning Opportunity**
   - Issues that provide valuable learning experiences or insights into best practices should be documented. This includes cases where the resolution leads to a better understanding of a technology or methodology.

5. **Copilot/GPT Interaction**
   - Problems where suggestions from Copilot or GPT are incorrect or misleading should be recorded. This helps in refining the use of AI tools and understanding their limitations.

6. **Potential for Reuse**
   - Issues that may arise again in future projects or components should be documented. This ensures that solutions can be reused, saving time and effort in future development cycles.

## Documentation Format
When documenting a problem, the following structure should be used:

- **Title**: A concise description of the problem.
- **Background**: Context about the project and the specific functionality affected.
- **Symptoms**: Description of the error or issue encountered.
- **Attempts**: Summary of the troubleshooting steps taken.
- **Solution**: The effective resolution of the problem, including any relevant explanations.
- **Value Explanation**: Justification for why this problem was recorded, highlighting its significance and potential impact on future work.

By adhering to these criteria, the MCP service aims to create a robust knowledge base that enhances the development process and fosters continuous learning.
